Display a custom disclosure text on your WooCommerce external/affiliate (or all) products.

== Description ==

This plugin is an [addon for WooCommerce](https://www.wpexplorer.com/best-woocommerce-extensions/) which adds a new tab in the [Customizer Panel](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-customizer/) so you can enter a custom affiliate disclosure text on your WooCommerce products.

You can enable the disclosure so it only displays on affiliate/external products or on all products. You can also select your placement from several available WooCommerce hooks (before button form, after button form, before button, after button, product meta start or productmeta end), alter the default font size and top/bottom padding.
